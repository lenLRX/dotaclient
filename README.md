# DotaService

_This project is a WIP weekend-project._

DotaService exposes Dota 2 as a service. It provides an observe-act loop, to play in an object-oriented way.

Example:

```py
from grpclib.client import Channel
from protobuf.DotaService_grpc import DotaServiceStub
from protobuf.DotaService_pb2 import Action
from protobuf.DotaService_pb2 import Config

# Connect to the DotaService.
env = DotaServiceStub(Channel('127.0.0.1', 50051))

# Get the initial observation.
observation = await env.reset(Config())
for i in range(8):
    action = Action(x=1, y=2, z=3)
    # Take an action, returning the resulting observation.
    observation = await env.step(action)
```

This is very useful to provide an environment for reinforcement learning, and service aspect of it makes it
especially useful for distributed training. I am planning to provide a client python
module for this (`PyDota`) that mimics typical OpenAI gym APIs.

# Notes


Create the protos

```sh
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --python_grpc_out=. protobuf/*.proto
```

Adding things to the Dota bot API's `package.path` in LUA doesn't seem to work. It refuses to
mount anything outside the `vscripts` directory. The solution is to mount your external disk simply
by linking the folder e.g.
```sh
ln -s /Volumes/ramdisk/ /Users/tzaman/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/scripts/vscripts
```


Check open sockets:
```sh
$ lsof -n -i | grep -e LISTEN -e ESTABLISHED
>>> dota2     1061 tzaman  215u  IPv4 0x84b2d9c103958a77      0t0  TCP *:12120 (LISTEN)
```

DOTA comes with TensorFlow libs (on ubuntu gives `failed to dlopen libtensorflow.so error=libtensorflow.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`), primarily used for dota plus features:

```sh
$ cat Steam/steamapps/common/dota\ 2\ beta/game/dota/bin/linuxsteamrt64/libserver.so | grep -a tensorflow
>>> tf_server_client_connect_timeout_stf_server_client_read_timeout_stf_server_client_write_timeout_stf_server_stats_spew_interval_sdota_suggest_spew_pregame_itemsdota_suggest_spew_win_probabilitydota_suggest_spew_win_probability_chatdota_suggest_pregame_items_reductiondota_suggest_pregame_items_thresholddota_suggest_item_sequence_allow_thresholddota_suggest_item_sequence_threshold_startdota_suggest_item_sequence_threshold_fulldota_suggest_item_sequence_other_option_multiplierdota_suggest_item_sequence_dupe_multiplierdota_suggest_lane_trilane_penaltydota_suggest_win_probability_interval
```

The bot script's LUA version is 5.1 and luajit-2.0.4.

Good command for dedicated bot 1v1
```sh
dota.sh \
-dedicated -insecure +map dota +sv_lan 1 +clientport 27006 +sv_cheats 1 \
-fill_with_bots -host_force_frametime_to_equal_tick_interval 1 \
-botworldstatetosocket_radiant 12120 -botworldstatetosocket_dire 12121 -botworldstatetosocket_frames 5 -botworldstatesocket_threaded \
+sv_hibernate_when_empty 0 +dota_auto_surrender_all_disconnected_timeout 180 +host_timescale 1 \
+dota_camera_edgemove 0
```

Clear dangling images.
```sh
docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)
```

Create a 4GB Ramdisk on MacOS
```sh
diskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'ramdisk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://8388608`
```

Person that worked on the dota bot api and OpenAI's contact at Valve is _Chris Carollo_.

On the DOTA client, `clientport` default is `27015`. Multiple steam clients on same router/computer should
have different clienports; corresponding option e.g.: `+clientport 27017`.
\
Mid 1v1 mode skips the 30s strategy; `+dota_force_gamemode 11 +dota_1v1_skip_strategy 1`.

Saving replays is impossibe by dedicated servers: need SourceTV (tv_*), `27020` is the default SourceTV port.
Clients can just connect with console command `connect ip:27020` and drop into the game.
Notice SourceTV is considered a Player and BOT, and usually gets the first index (1).

```sh
# /root/Steam/steamapps/common/dota\ 2\ beta/game/dota.sh -dedicated +map dota +sv_lan 1 +sv_hibernate_when_empty 0 +dota_auto_surrender_all_disconnected_timeout 180 +tv_enable 1 +tv_autorecord 1 +tv_dota_auto_record_stressbots 1 +tv_delay 0 +dota_force_gamemode 11 +dota_force_upload_match_stats 1
```
Playing demo: `playdemo $demfile` looks in `dota 2 beta/game/dota` folder, not in `/replays`!
Or you just do `playdemo replays/$demfile` and it'll work too.
Playing the auto-replay of GUI games (bot vs bot, or with human added) works. The auto-replay
of dedicated games seems to result in a fully black screen.

When you start a game with the GUI, the map is called `+map start`. If you have a dedicated
server running with `+map dota`, its replay stays black and doesn't seem to work. If you start it
with `+map start`, it will load with some errors, which are circumvented if you scroll to a certain
tick in the replay file.

What is the difference between game mod 11 (Mid Only) and 21 (Solo Mid 1 vs 1)?

With a speed of 300, it takes around 30 seconds to walk from spawn (fountain) to mid ~(0,0)

A mid game without heroes can already be over in 15 minutes by creeps alone taking the tower.

Even with `host_force_frametime_to_equal_tick_interval` set, there is a bug in dotatime, as there
is an extra tick inserted at 0; e.g.: `[-0.034439086914062, -0.0011062622070312, 0, 0.033332824707031]`.
The corresponding gamestates are `[4, 4, 5, 5]`, so the tick at exactly 0 is the `DOTA_GAMERULES_STATE_GAME_IN_PROGRESS`.
This is also a problem with the botworldstate; e.g. if you have a state every n frames, when it wraps
around zero time, it will add another tick there.

The game is trying to load C++ bot libraries using
dlopen with mode 6 (`RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_NOW`); `bots/botcpp_radiant.so` and `bots/botcpp_dire.so`.
It expects (for what i found using `LD_DEBUG=bindings LD_BIND_NOW=1`) an implemetation of `Init`,
`Observe`, `Act` and `Shutdown`.

Dota's worldstate server will clog up quickly with a host timescale of 10 and printing out every state
tick.

The worldstate can be set to be pushed every n ticks (`botworldstatetosocket_frames`) but the
tick at which it starts pushing is not deterministic.

The worldstate server starts even before the gameplay starts and bot Think's begin;
E.g. the states roll in at  dotatime `-75` (probably state `DOTA_GAMERULES_STATE_HERO_SELECTION`);
then jumps to `-59.97` after entering state `DOTA_GAMERULES_STATE_WAIT_FOR_MAP_TO_LOAD`.
Once it enters state 'DOTA_GAMERULES_STATE_PRE_GAME' it resets to dotatime `-90`.

The bot scripts are reloaded entirely with every game, not just once when booting dota.

The `CreateRemoteHTTPRequest` from the LUA api does not work when steam is off on my mac OS-X.
If I run in offline mode and/or take out my internet cable it works, but once the Steam client is
turned off, the HTTP request does not work anymore (returns `nil`). I wonder what the stability of
this part of the API is, should maybe avoid using.


The tick-to-dotatime relation is inaccurate, ticks aren't given in the worldstate too. Probably
an issue with float/double etc. So move away from ticks, and use time as %.2f integers, or time*30,
or just cut off until %.2f and then floor. On an hour long game, there were 29.981 ticks/s, which
makes me thing the ticks and s are unreliable, even with `host_force_frametime_to_equal_tick_interval` on,
which doesn't seem to help at all.

All the output from the lua console isn't flushed upon redicretion in python (or piping or tee).

The official proto for the botscript can be found here:
https://github.com/SteamDatabase/Protobufs/blob/master/dota2/dota_gcmessages_common_bot_script.proto

Source has options for streaming logs using udp `-log on` but none of that actually seems to work
with dota.
