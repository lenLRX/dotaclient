# DotaService

_This project is a WIP weekend-project._

DotaService exposes Dota 2 as a service. It provides an observe-act loop, to play in an object-oriented way.

This is very useful to provide an environment for reinforcement learning, and service aspect of it makes it
especially useful for distributed training. I am planning to provide a client python
module for this (`PyDota`) that mimics typical OpenAI gym APIs.

# Notes


Create the protos

```sh
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --python_grpc_out=. protobuf/*.proto
```

Adding things to the Dota bot API's `package.path` in LUA doesn't seem to work. It refuses to
mount anything outside the `vscripts` directory. The solution is to mount your external disk simply
by linking the folder e.g.
```sh
ln -s /Volumes/ramdisk/ /Users/tzaman/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/dota 2 beta/game/dota/scripts/vscripts
```


Check open sockets:
```sh
$ lsof -n -i | grep -e LISTEN -e ESTABLISHED
>>> dota2     1061 tzaman  215u  IPv4 0x84b2d9c103958a77      0t0  TCP *:12120 (LISTEN)
```

DOTA comes with TensorFlow libs, primarily used for dota plus features:

```sh
$ cat Steam/steamapps/common/dota\ 2\ beta/game/dota/bin/linuxsteamrt64/libserver.so | grep -a tensorflow
>>> tf_server_client_connect_timeout_stf_server_client_read_timeout_stf_server_client_write_timeout_stf_server_stats_spew_interval_sdota_suggest_spew_pregame_itemsdota_suggest_spew_win_probabilitydota_suggest_spew_win_probability_chatdota_suggest_pregame_items_reductiondota_suggest_pregame_items_thresholddota_suggest_item_sequence_allow_thresholddota_suggest_item_sequence_threshold_startdota_suggest_item_sequence_threshold_fulldota_suggest_item_sequence_other_option_multiplierdota_suggest_item_sequence_dupe_multiplierdota_suggest_lane_trilane_penaltydota_suggest_win_probability_interval
```

The bot script's LUA version is 5.1 and luajit-2.0.4.

Good command for dedicated bot 1v1
```sh
dota.sh \
-dedicated -insecure +map dota +sv_lan 1 +clientport 27006 +sv_cheats 1 \
-fill_with_bots -host_force_frametime_to_equal_tick_interval 1 \
-botworldstatetosocket_radiant 12120 -botworldstatetosocket_dire 12121 -botworldstatetosocket_frames 5 -botworldstatesocket_threaded \
+sv_hibernate_when_empty 0 +dota_auto_surrender_all_disconnected_timeout 180 +host_timescale 1 \
+dota_camera_edgemove 0
```

Clear dangling images.
```sh
docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)
```

Create a 4GB Ramdisk on MacOS
```sh
diskutil erasevolume HFS+ 'ramdisk' `hdiutil attach -nomount ram://8388608`
```

Person that worked on the dota bot api and OpenAI's contact at Valve is _Chris Carollo_.

On the DOTA client, `clientport` default is `27015`. Multiple steam clients on same router/computer should
have different clienports; corresponding option e.g.: `+clientport 27017`.
\
Mid 1v1 mode skips the 30s strategy; `+dota_force_gamemode 11 +dota_1v1_skip_strategy 1`.

Saving replays is impossibe by dedicated servers: need SourceTV (tv_*), `27020` is the default SourceTV port.
Clients can just connect with console command `connect ip:27020` and drop into the game.

```sh
# /root/Steam/steamapps/common/dota\ 2\ beta/game/dota.sh -dedicated +map dota +sv_lan 1 +sv_hibernate_when_empty 0 +dota_auto_surrender_all_disconnected_timeout 180 +tv_enable 1 +tv_autorecord 1 +tv_dota_auto_record_stressbots 1 +tv_delay 0 +dota_force_gamemode 11 +dota_force_upload_match_stats 1
```
Playing demo: `playdemo $demfile` looks in `dota 2 beta/game/dota` folder, not in `/replays`!
Or you just do `playdemo replays/$demfile` and it'll work too.
Playing the auto-replay of GUI games (bot vs bot, or with human added) works. The auto-replay
of dedicated games seems to result in a fully black screen.

When you start a game with the GUI, the map is called `+map start`. If you have a dedicated
server running with `+map dota`, its replay stays black and doesn't seem to work. If you start it
with `+map start`, it will load with some errors, which are circumvented if you scroll to a certain
tick in the replay file.

What is the difference between game mod 11 (Mid Only) and 21 (Solo Mid 1 vs 1)?

With a speed of 300, it takes around 30 seconds to walk from spawn (fountain) to mid ~(0,0)

A mid game without heroes can already be over in 15 minutes by creeps alone taking the tower.

Even with `host_force_frametime_to_equal_tick_interval` set, there is a bug in dotatime, as there
is an extra tick inserted at 0; e.g.: [-0.034439086914062, -0.0011062622070312, 0, 0.033332824707031].
